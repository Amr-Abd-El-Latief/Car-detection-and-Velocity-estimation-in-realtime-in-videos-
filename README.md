# Realtime-Car-detection-and-Car-Velocity-Estimation-in-videos
Matlab code based on matlab 2013 a example for car detection in videos adapted to estimate velocity of multiple cars in real time in videos. 

this was part of image processing course project for pre-master degree and it considered as prototype, not production (i.e. not clean Code ,and not for publish).

# when to USE :

1 - Learn About Car Detection using Blob analysis 

2 - learn about car detection in real time from videos using matlab

3 - learn example on matlab
